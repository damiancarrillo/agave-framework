     Agave is a library designed to enable rapid web application development through the use of handlers
     that field HTTP requests.  The handler methods are self-describing and need no more configuration 
     information beyond the method-level annotations that identify handlers and indicate how to treat
     user input.  During initialization of the context, the {@code /WEB-INF/classes} directory is scanned for
     all handlers and they are registered after they have been recognized.

     This all happens with the classes and annotations from the {@link agave agave} package.  The javadoc
     in that directory will serve as a good starting place for more information.  Another point of interest 
     will be the {@link agave.conversion agave.conversion} package, which will describe how form objects 
     will have the informations converted from a string into a higher-order object.
